Code demo for setting up gulp in a new project

GULP REFRESHER

Step 1: Inside the terminal, cd to the root folder of your project

Step 2: Copy in the gulpfile.js

Step 3: Make sure you have all the files ‘gulp’ requires in your project file structure. You can find these in the gulpfile.js as you scroll down.

Step 4: npm init 
  - is used to create a Node.js project
  - creates the package.json where the project files will be stored 
  - all the modules you download will be stored in the package

Step 5: npm i gulp --save-dev 
  - this installs the ‘gulp’ package in your dev dependencies

Step 6: npm i gulp-sass gulp-livereload gulp-connect gulp-jslint gulp-rename gulp-minify-css --save-dev 
  - this installs all the other packages you need in your dev dependencies.
